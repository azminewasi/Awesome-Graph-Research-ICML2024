# **Awesome ICML 2024 Graph Paper Collection**

This repo contains a comprehensive compilation of **graph and/or GNN** papers that were accepted at the [International Conference on Machine Learning 2024](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2024/Conference). Graph or Geometric machine learning possesses an indispensable role within the domain of machine learning research, providing invaluable insights, methodologies, and solutions to a diverse array of challenges and problems. 

**Short Overview**: We've got around 250 papers focusing on Graphs and GNNs in ICML'24.
The core themes of this year include [equivariant GNNs](#Equivariant), [OODs](#OOD), [diffusions](#Diffusion), [heterophily](#Heterophily), [expressivity](#Expressivity), and [clustering](#Clustering). There's also a good amount of [casual graph](#casual) works, more than I expected. We have some very good [physics-inspired](#PDE) research too. 
A lot of [application](#apps) papers are available, although I expected to see more in [molecular, chemical GNNs](#molecular) and [GFlowNets](#GFlowNets). [Reinforcement learning](#RL) also had a good boost this year.
**Have a look and throw me a review (and, a star ‚≠ê, maybe!)** Thanks!

## GNN Theories 

<a name="Weisfeiler-Leman " />

#### Weisfeiler Leman 
<!---[1] demonstrate that increased expressivity in GNNs does not guarantee better generalization performance, propose 1-WL-based architectures with provable generalization, and [2] enhance transformers alignment with the $k$-WL hierarchy for improved feasibility and predictive performance. [3] extend $2$-WL universality to point clouds with positions and velocities, introducing the WeLNet architecture.
